Entrepreneurs, designers, and developers work in teams to create cool apps or prototypes for web or mobile platforms.<br><br>But Blueprint is not just a hackathon.</span><h5>So how is Blueprint different?</h5><span>Blueprint is a Pilot event, a sort of combination of a hackathon and a 12-hour workshop focused on creativity, collaboration, and learning by doing. Our event is for high school students of all skill levels—it’s totally fine if you’ve never programmed before! All you need is interest and creativity; our team of world-class mentors will help you learn the rest. You’ll get to meet mentors from a variety of innovative companies, as well as talk to entrepreneurs involved in the startup scene.<br>If you are more experienced, you’ll be able to focus on building your idea with your team, and consult with our expert mentors as needed.</span><h5>Who can participate?</h5><span>Blueprint is open to all high school students! Coding experience is not required. You aren't required to have ever attended a hackathon before: we will have presentations and mentors so you can ramp up quickly. You can come with a team or come alone - there will be a place for you.</span></div><div class="six"><h5>Do I need a team? Will I be able to find a team? Can I do it alone?</h5><span>Nope! We will have sessions to help people find team members and form teams, as well as an idea generation workshop to help people think of ideas to work on for the hackathon.</span><h5>How do I cancel my registration?</h5><span>Forward us your registration confirmation email at <a href="mailto:blueprint@hackmit.org">blueprint@hackmit.org</a> and specify that you wish to cancel in the subject/body text.</span><h5>Will there be food?</h5><span>Don’t worry: there will be a lot of great, healthy food. We’ll have the standard breakfast, lunch, and dinner as well as frequent snacks. We'll make sure you are fed well!</span><h5>How does judging work?</h5><span>Our panel of judges will rate your app based on creativity, technical difficulty, polish, and usefulness. Companies will be sponsoring prizes in a variety of categories.</span><h5>What should I bring?</h5><span>Laptop and charger. All attendees are required to bring a valid photo ID for admission (name must match registration).</span><h5>Can I start my project before the event?</h5><span>No. To make sure everyone has an equal opportunity at building a project, you may not begin your project until the start of Blueprint (8AM on February 22, 2014).</span></div><div class="clear"></div></div><div class="wrap"><h3>Day-of Event Info</h3><div class="six"><h5>How do I check-in?</h5><span>Check-in will be from 8&ndash;9AM on the ground floor of the building. All you need is a valid photo ID.</span><h5>How long is the event?</h5><span>Doors open at 8AM, Kick-off at 9AM. The event ends at 10:30PM.</span><h5>Can I bring my parents?</h5><span>Unfortunately, we don't have enough space to accommodate parents during the day. We will broadcast our closing ceremony online on our website—we’ll send out the link beforehand.</span></div><div class="six"><h5>Do I have to be there the entire time?</h5><span>For security reasons, you must stay in the building for the duration of the event. If your parent or guardian needs to pick you up before the conclusion, he or she will need to contact event staff and check you out through our registration system.</span><h5>I have a question that's not listed here. Who should I ask?</h5><span>Email us at <a href="mailto:blueprint@hackmit.org">blueprint@hackmit.org</a>.</span></div><div class="clear"></div></div></div><footer class="section"><div class="wrap dark"><p><a href="#" class="top"><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-up"></i> Top of Page</a></p><p>Organized by TechX HackMIT, an MIT student organization. <br> Contact us at <a href="mailto:blueprint@hackmit.org">blueprint@hackmit.org</a> or via <a href="https://twitter.com/MITBlueprint">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mitblueprint">Facebook</a>.</p><div class="links"><h4><a href="/BlueprintParents.pdf">For parents &raquo;</a></h4><h4><a href="/BlueprintMentors.pdf">For mentors &raquo;</a></h4><h4><a href="/BlueprintMediaKit.zip">Media kit &raquo;</a></h4></div><div class="break"></div></div></footer><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/jquery.formatter.js"></script><script src="/js/main.js"> </script><script>
